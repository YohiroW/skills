# Style discovery

**This is the "show, don't tell" phase.** Most people can't articulate design preferences in words.

### Step 2.0: Generate 3 Style Previews Directly

Based on purpose, audience, mood, and content density, generate 3 distinct single-slide HTML previews showing typography, colors, animation, and overall aesthetic.

Do not ask the user whether they want options or a preset picker. The default discovery experience is always visual comparison.

If the user already gave a vibe, use it. If they did not, infer the likely mood from the occasion, audience, content, and stakes. Keep the options diverse enough that the user can react visually instead of needing to articulate taste up front.

If the user already selected a style, use it directly unless they requested alternatives. Likewise, choose a suitable style and continue when the user asks you to decide.

Read [STYLE_PRESETS.md](../STYLE_PRESETS.md) for safe preset candidates. If [bold-template-pack/selection-index.json](../bold-template-pack/selection-index.json) exists, read that compact index too, but do not read any `design.md` files yet.

| Mood                | Suggested Presets                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Impressed/Confident | Bold Signal, Electric Studio, Dark Botanical       |
| Excited/Energized   | Creative Voltage, Neon Cyber, Split Pastel         |
| Calm/Focused        | Notebook Tabs, Paper & Ink, Swiss Modern           |
| Inspired/Moved      | Dark Botanical, Vintage Editorial, Pastel Geometry |

**Preview mix rules:**

- Generate 3 previews by default: 1 safe preset from `STYLE_PRESETS.md`, at least 1 bold template from `bold-template-pack/selection-index.json`, and 1 wildcard.
- The wildcard may be either a second bold template or a self-generated custom design. Choose whichever creates the strongest, most useful contrast for the user's occasion, audience, mood, and content.
- Do not force every expressive option to come from the template library. If the brief has a sharper, more specific design opportunity than the available templates, use the wildcard slot to design freely.
- For conservative or high-stakes decks, make the safe preset especially restrained; choose a calm, higher-formality bold template; make the wildcard either another restrained template or a custom design that feels authoritative rather than decorative.
- For expressive decks, keep the safe preset as a readable fallback; choose one strong bold template; make the wildcard adventurous, context-specific, and clearly different from both other previews.
- If bold template matches feel weak, use the wildcard as a custom design or fall back to another safe preset instead of forcing a template.

**Custom wildcard design rules:**

- Follow the visual-direction guidance in `SKILL.md`: choose purposeful typography, coherent colors, and topic-specific layouts rather than applying one generic dashboard/card look.
- Match the user's stated occasion, audience, mood/vibe, and content density. The custom design should feel authored for this deck, not merely "stylish."
- Make a deliberate visual thesis: distinctive typography, a committed palette, a recognizable layout system, and one strong atmospheric or graphic device.
- Keep it feasible for a full deck. The preview must imply a design system that can expand into section, content, quote, comparison, and closing slides.
- Use fixed 1920×1080 stage rules and pass the same preview authenticity checks as every other option.
- Never render "custom", "wildcard", "AI-generated", or design-process labels on the slide itself.

**Bold template selection rules:**

- Match user purpose and mood against `mood`, `tone`, `best_for`, `avoid_for`, `formality`, `density`, and `scheme`.
- Treat `best_for` examples as soft signals, not strict industry filters.
- Keep the three previews genuinely different from each other.
- After choosing bold template candidate(s), read only those candidate(s)' `preview.md` files from the `preview_md` paths in the selection index.
- Use `preview.md` only for title-slide previews. Do not read full `design.md` files until the user picks the final template.
- The upstream `template.html` files are not bundled. Use the selected preview and design documents as the local references.

**Preview authenticity rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**

- Every style preview must look like a real first slide from the user's deck, not a diagnostic card.
- Never render internal workflow text on a slide: no `preview`, `generated from`, `preview.md`, `template`, `preset`, `style option`, `Option A/B/C`, file names, paths, or source-doc labels.
- Never render template names or slug names on the slide itself. Template/style names belong only in the message to the user.
- Never render user requirement notes as slide content, such as "sharp and provocative", "safe option", "bold option", "for internal sharing", or "audience: ...", unless the user explicitly wants that exact phrase to appear in the deck.
- If the slide needs chrome, use real deck chrome only: the deck title, section title, date, author, company, page number, or a genuine content phrase from the user's material.
- Before opening previews, inspect the visible text and revise if any internal metadata appears.

Resolve template paths from the skill root. Save previews to the current task scratch directory (for example `work/slide-previews/`) (style-a.html, style-b.html, style-c.html). Each should be self-contained and compact, showing one animated title slide.

Show previews using the available Codex browser/file-opening tools, or supply local links if no browser UI is available.

### Step 2.1: User Picks

Ask (header: "Style"):
Which style preview do you prefer? Options: Style A: [Name] / Style B: [Name] / Style C: [Name] / Mix elements

If "Mix elements", ask for specifics.
